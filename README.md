## Reflection

I believe that I have achieved all of the required goals, the page is laid out with a navigation bar, using semantical html tags, header, nav, section, for example.
I utilized CSS absolute positioning to align the feature contents inside of each section, and utilized flexboxes to create a clean looking header/navigation bar, and to aid with aligning the content within each of the feature sections.

For Stretch goals, I have added a back to the top button, utilized css for smooth scrolling, as well as utilized CSS styling to make the button elements interactive.

I later decided to try to add background playing music to the page, however, this failed to act as I liked due to chromes
policy of blocking autoplay media until a user has interacted with the page. I tossed some JS together to try to enable it
as soon as we can.

I hope to gain more experience with CSS in order to achieve more in terms of interactivity with a website, for example, I really wanted to make the "go to top" button animate when transitioning states, however, found myself unable to achieve this within a timely manner. I will potentially look further into this.
